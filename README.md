   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the `server/` directory using `.env.example` as a reference:
   ```
   PORT=3001
   MONGO_URL=your-mongodb-connection-string
   JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
   ```

4. Start the backend server using Nodemon:
   ```bash
   nodemon index.js
   ```

---

### 🌠 Frontend Setup

   cd client
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## ☁️ Free Deployment (Render)

This repo includes a `render.yaml` blueprint for a free deployment on Render.

1. Create a Render account and select **New > Blueprint**.
2. Connect the repository and follow the prompts.
3. Set environment variables:
   - **API service**: `MONGO_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`
   - **Static site**: `REACT_APP_API_URL` (set to the Render API URL), optional `REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL`
4. Deploy. Render will build the client and start the server using the provided blueprint.

## 🧪 Sample Test Accounts

Once the platform reaches the **testing phase** — when both the backend and frontend are working seamlessly together — you can register using test credentials of your choice and explore the application functionality.

There’s no need for predefined accounts; simply **sign up**, log in, and start orbiting through the features.
